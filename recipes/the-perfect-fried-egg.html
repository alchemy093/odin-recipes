            The humble fried egg is, from the perspective of the ingredients and tools required, about as simple as it gets for a recipe. A fried egg trades instead upon the execution of the cook, and it requires
            one to be perceptive and alert. The perfect egg (citation needed) has solidified and crisped whites, along with a yolk that has thickened, but runs slowly when pierced. The difference between this renaissance ideal of a frieg egg and a fully scrambled yolk or a watery mess is about thirty seconds, perhaps a minute. The window of time that stands between a good fried egg and a perfect one is even smaller.
            Practice often - and be mindful of what you are seeing, hearing, and smelling as you do. We cook with our senses - the mechanical actions we take can only be as good as the judgements they were informed by. The quality of these judgements, or what an experienced cook might call intuitions, can be improved with practice. In comparing our judgements - "The white is still pretty clear (observation) and slimy in some places- but I think it will firm up (judgement) when I take it off the heat (proposed action)." with the results "Oh no - I took it out too soon! The white is still slimy on top and the yolk is watery! (feedback)", we train our ability to make these inferences. In this way - the humble fried egg is an exercise in mindfulness, and one that helps us to anchor ourselves more closely with reality. As well - this process of examining our observations, our judgements, our actions, and our results is universal. I will end by recalling a Quora post that I once read, in which a man remarked that "If you can learn how to skateboard, you can become a millionaire." 
            I believe that he is right.

                    Put some olive oil in your skillet - a bit more than you think you'll need. We will be spooning some of it to cook the top of the egg later.

                <li>
                    Have your seasoning ready right next to the pan. Crack your egg(s) in the pan, and season them right away. 
                </li>

                <li>
                   As the bottom starts to cook, tilt your (hopefully small, 6-8 inch) skillet so that some of the oil pools on one side. Use a spoon to spoon some of the oil on top of the egg and cook the white on top along with the yolk.
        
                </li>

                <li>Remove when white is no longer goopy and the yolk is just right. Enjoy!</li>
