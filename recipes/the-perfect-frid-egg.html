            The humble fried egg is, from the perspective of the ingredients and tools required, about as simple as it gets for a recipe. In terms of the execution required, however, it is a very active recipe that requires
            a cook to be perceptive and alert. The difference between a perfect, over medium egg where the yolk has thickened but still runs when pierced and a scrambled interior or a watery mess is literal seconds when we are frying in a hot pan.
            Practice often, and be mindful of what you are seeing, hearing, and smelling as you do so.

                <li>
                    Put some olive oil in your skillet - a bit more than you think you'll need. We will be spooning some of it to cook the top of the egg later.

                <li>
                    Have your seasoning ready right next to the pan. Crack your egg(s) in the pan, and season them right away. 
                </li>

                <li>
                   As the bottom starts to cook, tilt your (hopefully small, 6-8 inch) skillet so that some of the oil pools on one side. Use a spoon to spoon some of the oil on top of the egg and cook the white on top along with the yolk.
        
                </li>

                <li>Remove when white is no longer goopy and the yolk is just right. Enjoy!</li>
